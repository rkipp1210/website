I really like arduino and I really like plot.ly. We use plotly at work to provide better interaction with data in our web apps, and their online workspace is fantastic.

When I saw a tutorial for getting started with arduino and plotly, I had to try it. Check it out

The code is pretty straightforward, and they now even fill it the relevant credentials for you at the above link! Clever folks over there at plot.ly.

Check out my data!

Give it a try! It's a lot of fun, and pretty easy.

Future plans:

- Add more temperature sensors throughout the apartment
- Add more types of sensors inside
- Include an outdoor sensor
